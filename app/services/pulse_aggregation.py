"""
Global Pulse Aggregation Service

Pure functions that turn raw (problems, country_code, created_at) check-in
rows into the public, privacy-safe Global Pulse snapshot. No DB access here
— routes fetch rows and pass them in, which keeps this logic unit-testable
without a database connection.

Privacy model (see docstring on each function for detail):
  1. Minimum group size (MIN_AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD) — a country or category
     is never shown with fewer than this many check-ins behind it, and this
     applies independently to *every* count in the response: totals per
     category, per country, and per category-within-country.
  2. Visibility delay (VISIBILITY_DELAY) — a check-in only counts toward
     what's displayed once it is older than this delay. This is the load-
     bearing mitigation for before/after polling attacks (see
     build_snapshot's docstring): an attacker's own fresh submission cannot
     move any number in the response until it has aged past the delay, so
     "submit one check-in, diff the aggregate immediately" reveals nothing.
  3. Count bucketing (bucket_count) — once a group is large enough to show,
     its displayed count is a coarse range (e.g. "5-9") rather than an exact
     integer, so crossing a boundary can't be read back as "exactly N now."

    IMPORTANT: `problem_rows`, `country_counts`, and `checkin_rows` must

    the one exception — it reflects all check-ins ever recorded, including
    ones still inside the visibility delay, since it's a single coarse
    number with no category/geography attached and the product wants it to
    move immediately on every submission.

    Why the before/after polling attack no longer works:
      An attacker submits one check-in and immediately re-queries this
      endpoint. That check-in's created_at is "now," which is always more
      recent than visibility_cutoff() — so it is excluded from every
      per-category and per-country count in `categories`, `countries`, and
      `map` for the next VISIBILITY_DELAY_MINUTES. The response the
      attacker sees immediately after their submission is therefore
      byte-for-byte identical (for those three fields) to the response
      before it. By the time the check-in *does* become eligible (after the
      delay), it has been mixed in among however many other check-ins
      arrived during that same window — the attacker can no longer
      distinguish "this exact submission" from "any other submission that
      also aged in around the same time," and even then only ever observes
      a bucketed range, not an exact count.
